# Notes

### Remark regarding part 1:

For part one I use the fact that I know that the interval on the specific y-level is in fact only one interval and not broken up in multiple ones.

### Explanation of part 2:

For part two I use the fact that the point has to be on the edge of some sensors reach. Therefore I calculate all the geometrical lines passing those edges. Because I also know that the point has to be surrounded by edges I calculate all possible intersection by the lines going up and down. Those specific spots are then checked individually.
